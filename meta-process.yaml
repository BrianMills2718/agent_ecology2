# Meta-Process Configuration
# ==========================
#
# Controls enforcement strictness for meta-process checks.

# Weight Level (Plan #218)
# Controls which checks run. Higher weight = more enforcement.
# Levels: heavy, medium, light, minimal
weight: medium

# Per-check overrides (optional)
# Values: "strict" (force on), "disabled" (force off), or omit for weight default.
overrides: {}

# Enforcement

  # Auto-add new plan files to docs/plans/CLAUDE.md index

  # When true, ALL doc-code couplings fail CI on violation (including soft: true)
  # When false, only strict couplings block; soft couplings are advisory warnings
  strict_doc_coupling: false

# Visibility (Plan #309)
# Controls whether hook-injected context is surfaced to the user.
# Options: automatic (always show), on-demand (only when user asks), both
visibility:
  # Governance context, edit constraints, coupled doc info

  # Post-edit quiz questions
