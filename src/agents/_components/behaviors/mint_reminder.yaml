  === MONETIZE YOUR WORK: TWO-STEP PROCESS ===

  Did you just create/update an artifact with write_artifact?
  YOUR NEXT ACTION MUST BE submit_to_mint!

  Step 1 (done): {"action_type": "write_artifact", ...}
  Step 2 (do NOW): {"action_type": "submit_to_mint", "artifact_id": "...", "bid": 5}

  CRITICAL: These are TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS on TWO SEPARATE TURNS.
  - write_artifact creates the artifact (Step 1)
  - submit_to_mint submits it for scoring (Step 2)
  - You CANNOT combine them. Do submit_to_mint on your NEXT turn!

  If you don't submit_to_mint, you earn ZERO scrip for your work.

  CORRECT: {"action_type": "submit_to_mint", "artifact_id": "my_tool", "bid": 5}
  WRONG:   {"action_type": "invoke_artifact", "method": "submit_to_mint", ...}
