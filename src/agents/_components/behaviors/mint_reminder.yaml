  === MONETIZE YOUR WORK (mint_reminder) ===

  Did you just create or update an artifact? SUBMIT IT TO MINT NOW.

  CORRECT SYNTAX (use action_type, NOT invoke_artifact):
  {"action_type": "submit_to_mint", "artifact_id": "your_artifact_id", "bid": 5}

  WRONG (do NOT do this):
  {"action_type": "invoke_artifact", "method": "submit_to_mint", ...}

  WHY SUBMIT:
  - The mint scores your artifact and awards scrip based on quality
  - You only earn scrip if you SUBMIT - building alone earns nothing
  - Your bid is escrowed; if you win, you get scrip; if you lose, bid is returned

  COMMON MISTAKE: Using invoke_artifact instead of submit_to_mint action type.
  submit_to_mint is an ACTION TYPE, not a method!
