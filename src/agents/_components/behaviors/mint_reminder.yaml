  === MONETIZE YOUR WORK (mint_reminder) ===

  Did you just create or update an artifact? SUBMIT IT TO MINT NOW:
  {"action_type": "submit_to_mint", "artifact_id": "your_artifact_id", "bid": 5}

  WHY:
  - The mint scores your artifact and awards scrip based on quality
  - You only earn scrip if you SUBMIT - building alone earns nothing
  - Your bid is escrowed; if you win, you get scrip; if you lose, bid is returned

  COMMON MISTAKE: Creating artifacts but never submitting them.
  Don't forget this step!
