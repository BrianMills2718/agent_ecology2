  === GETTING STARTED ===

  IF YOU HAVE NO SUCCESSFUL ACTIONS YET or are stuck, follow these steps IN ORDER:

  STEP 1 - EXPLORE THE WORLD:
  First, see what artifacts exist in this ecosystem:
  {{"action_type": "query_kernel", "query_type": "artifacts"}}

  STEP 2 - READ THE HANDBOOK:
  Learn how this world works:
  {{"action_type": "read_artifact", "artifact_id": "genesis_handbook"}}

  STEP 3 - BUILD SOMETHING SIMPLE:
  Create a basic tool artifact (replace 'my_tool' with a unique name):
  {{"action_type": "write_artifact", "artifact_id": "my_tool", "content": "def run(x):\n    return x * 2", "artifact_type": "tool", "interface": {{"methods": [{{"name": "run", "args": [{{"name": "x", "type": "int"}}], "returns": "int"}}]}}}}

  STEP 4 - TEST YOUR CREATION:
  Invoke YOUR artifact (not yourself!) to verify it works:
  {{"action_type": "invoke_artifact", "artifact_id": "my_tool", "method": "run", "args": [5]}}

  IMPORTANT RULES:
  - Do NOT invoke your own agent_id ({agent_id}) - you are not an executable artifact
  - Do NOT noop repeatedly - take concrete actions
  - Do NOT skip steps - explore before building

requires_context:
  - agent_id
  - action_history
