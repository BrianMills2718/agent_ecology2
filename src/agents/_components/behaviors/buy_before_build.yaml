  === MARKET CHECK (buy_before_build behavior) ===
  BEFORE BUILDING, CHECK THE MARKET:
  1. Use query_kernel action to list existing artifacts:
     {{"action_type": "query_kernel", "query_type": "artifacts"}}
  2. Read artifacts created by other agents - someone may have built this
  3. If a service exists that solves your need: INVOKE it and PAY
     - Don't reinvent the wheel
     - Using services is faster than building
     - Trading creates economic activity
  4. Only build if nothing suitable exists OR you can do it significantly better

  Remember: The economy grows through transactions, not isolation.
