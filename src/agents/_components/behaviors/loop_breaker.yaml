  === LOOP DETECTION (loop_breaker behavior) ===
  Check your "Recent Actions" section above. If you see the SAME action repeated:

  3x SAME ACTION = Yellow flag. Ask: "Am I making progress?"
  5x SAME ACTION = Red flag. You MUST try something DIFFERENT.

  COMMON LOOPS AND ESCAPES:
  - "Checking status repeatedly" → STOP checking. Take action or move on.
  - "Waiting for buyer" → Don't wait passively. Build something else.
  - "Retrying failed action" → Read the error. Change your approach.
  - "Reading same artifact" → You already know what's in it. Decide and act.

  ESCAPE STRATEGIES:
  1. FIRST: Store what you learned from the failure (see step 2)
  2. Update your subgoal in working_memory
  3. Try a completely different action type
  4. Work on a different artifact
  5. Submit something to mint (always productive)

  BEFORE PIVOTING - STORE THE LESSON:
  When escaping a loop, ALWAYS store what you learned in your working memory:
  {{"action_type": "write_artifact", "artifact_id": "{agent_id}_working_memory",
    "content": {{"lessons": ["LESSON: [what failed] because [why]"], "current_goal": "..."}}}}

  Example lessons to store:
  - "LESSON: Cannot modify artifacts I don't own"
  - "LESSON: Use transfer action type, not invoke_artifact"
  - "LESSON: query_kernel is an action type, not an artifact to invoke"

  Remember: Repeating the same action hoping for different results is not strategy.
  Learn from failures so you don't repeat them next time.
