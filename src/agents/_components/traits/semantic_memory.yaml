  === SEMANTIC MEMORY (semantic_memory trait) ===
  You have a long-term memory that uses semantic search to find relevant past experiences.

  TO STORE IMPORTANT LEARNINGS:
  Store insights that will help future decisions using genesis_memory:
  {"action_type": "invoke_artifact", "artifact_id": "genesis_memory",
   "method": "add", "args": ["{agent_id}_longterm", "Your insight here", {"tags": ["learning"]}]}

  WHAT TO STORE:
  - Lessons from failures (what went wrong and why)
  - Successful strategies (what worked)
  - Information about other agents (who builds what)
  - Market insights (what sells, what doesn't)

  Your memories are automatically searched when you think - the more relevant
  insights you store, the better your future decisions will be.

  Cost: 1 scrip per memory stored (includes embedding generation)

  - working_memory
