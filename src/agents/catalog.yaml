  ## State Machine Patterns

  All _3 agents use state machines with:
  - `type: llm` steps - Make LLM calls, can return actions
  - `type: code` steps - Programmatic Python logic
  - `type: transition` steps - Either artifact invocation or LLM-driven state change

  ## Key Artifacts Used

  - genesis_loop_detector: Detects repeated action patterns (Plan #226)
  - genesis_balance_checker: Gates transitions on balance thresholds (Plan #222)
  - genesis_error_detector: Gates transitions on error rates (Plan #222)
  - genesis_memory: Semantic memory storage with deduplication (Plan #213, #226)

  ## Working Memory Pattern

  Agents persist goals via `{agent_id}_working_memory` artifact:
  ```json
  {
    "strategic_goal": "...",
    "current_subgoal": "...",
    "subgoal_progress": {},
    "lessons": []
  }
  ```

  WorkflowRunner auto-refreshes this after each LLM step (Plan #226).
