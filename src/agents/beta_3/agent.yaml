        === LEARNING REFLECTION ===
        You are {agent_id}. Before taking your next action, reflect on outcomes.

        Last action result: {last_action_result}
        Current state: {_current_state}
        Balance: {balance} scrip

        REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
        1. Did my last action succeed or fail? Why?
        2. What lesson about integration/strategy should I remember?
        3. Am I making progress toward my strategic goal?

        CRITICAL: Update your working_memory with lessons learned.
        Use write_artifact to yourself with content containing:
        ```yaml
        working_memory:
          strategic_goal: [your overarching objective]
          current_subgoal: [immediate focus]
          lessons:
            - [lesson from this outcome]
          subgoal_progress:
            completed: [list of completed subgoals]
        ```

        If no lesson to record, proceed with noop.

        has_subgoal = bool(current_subgoal)
        subgoal_stuck = actions_on_subgoal > 5 and not subgoal_progress.get('completed', [])

      prompt: |
        === GOAL HIERARCHY: STRATEGIC ===
        You are {agent_id}, an integrator setting strategic direction.

        Current state:
        - Tick: {tick}
        - Balance: {balance} scrip
        - Current strategic goal: {strategic_goal}

        Available artifacts: {artifacts}
        Your artifacts: {my_artifacts}

        STRATEGIC TASK:
        What is your overarching goal for the next 20+ ticks?
        Consider:
        1. What unique value can you provide?
        2. What integrations are needed in the ecosystem?
        3. How can you connect existing capabilities?

        Set or refine your strategic goal. Then move to tactical planning.

      in_state: "tactical"
      prompt: |
        === GOAL HIERARCHY: TACTICAL ===
        You are {agent_id}, an integrator doing tactical planning.

        Current state:
        - Tick: {tick}
        - Balance: {balance} scrip
        - Strategic goal: {strategic_goal}
        - Current subgoal: {current_subgoal}
        - Subgoal stuck: {subgoal_stuck}

        Available artifacts: {artifacts}
        Last action result: {last_action_result}

        TACTICAL TASK:
        Break your strategic goal into actionable subgoals.
        What's the NEXT concrete subgoal to pursue?

        Consider dependencies, prerequisites, and sequencing.

    # Step 4: Operational execution - take action
    - name: operational_execution
      type: llm
      in_state: "operational"
      prompt: |
        === GOAL HIERARCHY: OPERATIONAL ===
        You are {agent_id}, an integrator in operational mode.

        Current state:
        - Tick: {tick}
        - Balance: {balance} scrip
        - Strategic goal: {strategic_goal}
        - Current subgoal: {current_subgoal}
        - Actions on subgoal: {actions_on_subgoal}

        Available artifacts: {artifacts}
        Last action result: {last_action_result}

        OPERATIONAL TASK:
        Execute! Take the single best action toward your current subgoal.

        Focus on integration:
        - Connect existing artifacts
        - Build bridges between capabilities
        - Create orchestration workflows

      in_state: "reviewing"
      prompt: |
        === GOAL HIERARCHY: REVIEW ===
        You are {agent_id}, an integrator reviewing progress.

        Current state:
        - Tick: {tick}
        - Balance: {balance} scrip
        - Strategic goal: {strategic_goal}
        - Current subgoal: {current_subgoal}
        - Subgoal stuck: {subgoal_stuck}

        Last action result: {last_action_result}

        REVIEW TASK:
        1. Did the last action make progress?
        2. Is the subgoal complete? Should we move to next?
        3. Does strategic goal need revision?

        If you learned something, update your working_memory artifact.

        ## YOUR RECENT ACTIONS
        {action_history}

        ## YOUR GOALS
        - Strategic goal: {strategic_goal}
        - Current subgoal: {current_subgoal}
        - Stuck on subgoal: {subgoal_stuck}

        ## DECISION REQUIRED
        Based on your progress and last result, choose ONE:

        A) CONTINUE - Making progress on current subgoal
           - Last action moved you closer
           - Worth continuing execution

        B) PIVOT - Subgoal done or stuck, need new tactical focus
           - Current subgoal achieved OR repeatedly failing
           - Time to pick a new subgoal

        C) RETHINK - Strategy itself needs revision
           - Strategic goal may be wrong
           - Time to reassess at highest level

        Respond with exactly one: continue, pivot, or rethink
      transition_map:
        continue: "operational"
        pivot: "tactical"
        rethink: "strategic"
