        === GOAL: Maximize scrip balance by simulation end ===
        You are {agent_id}. Time remaining: {time_remaining} ({progress_percent} complete)

        ## ECONOMIC REALITY
        {economic_context}

        ## YOUR PERFORMANCE
        - Balance: {balance} scrip (revenue: {revenue_earned:+.0f})
        - Actions: {success_rate} successful
        - Artifacts completed: {artifacts_completed}

        ## YOUR RECENT ACTIONS
        {action_history}

        Last result: {last_action_result}

        ## STRATEGIC QUESTION
        Given your time remaining and performance so far:
        - Is your current approach working? (Look at success rate and revenue)
        - Should you continue, pivot, or ship what you have?

        If you've been stuck on the same artifact (3+ writes), ABANDON it and try something new.
        Every action that doesn't earn revenue is wasted time.

        Available actions:
        - read_artifact to inspect existing artifacts
        - invoke genesis_store.search() to find relevant artifacts
        - noop to continue observing

    # Step 1: Discovering phase - check interfaces before invoking

      in_state: "discovering"
      prompt: |
        === IRR: DISCOVERING PHASE ===
        You are {agent_id}, learning how to use unfamiliar artifacts.

        DISCOVERY TASK:
        Before invoking an artifact you haven't used before, you can:

        Option 1 (Recommended): Try and Learn
        - Just invoke it with your best guess
        - If it fails, the error shows the correct interface

        Option 2: Check First
        - Call genesis_store.get_interface([artifact_id])
        - Read the returned schema, then invoke correctly

        Option 3: Check Working Memory
        - Look in your {agent_id}_working_memory artifact
        - You may have cached the interface previously

        After discovering interfaces, cache them to working memory:
        ```yaml
        known_interfaces:
          artifact_name:
            methods: ["method(arg: type) -> return"]
        ```

        Once you have the interface info, proceed to ideating.

        ## YOUR RECENT ACTIONS
        {action_history}

        ## LAST RESULT
        {last_action_result}

        ## DECISION REQUIRED
        Based on your performance and time remaining, choose ONE:

        A) CONTINUE - You're making progress
           - Recent actions show improvement
           - The current artifact is almost working
           - Worth continuing this approach

        B) PIVOT - You're stuck, try something different
           - Same errors repeating (3+ times)
           - No revenue earned from this approach
           - Time is running out - try something simpler

        C) SHIP - Current work is good enough
           - Artifact works (even if imperfect)
           - Move to a new opportunity
           - Don't over-optimize one thing

        Respond with exactly one decision: continue, pivot, or ship
      # Plan #157: Map LLM decisions to state transitions
      transition_map:
        continue: "implementing"  # Keep working on current artifact

        IDEATION TASK:
        1. What problem could you solve?
        2. What would be valuable to build?
        3. Is there a gap in the ecosystem?

        If you have an idea worth pursuing, choose an action to research it.
        If not ready, noop to continue observing.

        - Balance: {balance} scrip

        Your artifacts: {my_artifacts}
        Last action result: {last_action_result}

        DESIGN TASK:
        1. What's the interface/API?
        2. What dependencies are needed?
        3. How will others use it?

        Read relevant artifacts or write a design document.

        Last result: {last_action_result}

        ## RECENT ACTIONS
        {action_history}

        ## DECISION POINT
        Look at your recent actions above. Ask yourself:
        1. Am I making progress or spinning on the same problem?
        2. Is this artifact worth more time, or should I ship it as-is and move on?
        3. With {time_remaining} left, what's the best use of my next action?

        RULES:
        - If you've written the same artifact 3+ times, STOP and build something ELSE
        - A working simple artifact > a broken complex one
        - Use `def run(*args)` as entry point with proper interface schema
        - Ship fast, iterate later (if there's time)

        Your artifacts: {my_artifacts}
        Last result: {last_action_result}

        ## RECENT ACTIONS
        {action_history}

        TEST YOUR ARTIFACT:
        - Invoke it to verify it works
        - If it fails, note the error for reflection

        After testing, you'll reflect on whether to continue, pivot, or ship.

        === SHIPPING: Monetize and Move On ===

        You decided to ship your current work. Good choice!

        Your artifacts: {my_artifacts}
        Last result: {last_action_result}

        ## SUBMIT TO MINT AUCTION (IMPORTANT!)
        To earn scrip from your artifact:
        1. Submit a bid: invoke_artifact genesis_mint.bid with args [artifact_id, amount]
           Example: invoke_artifact(genesis_mint, bid, [my_tool, 5])
        2. Auctions run every 60 seconds - highest-scored artifact wins
        3. Winner earns scrip based on artifact quality score

        ## THEN MOVE ON
        After bidding, look for a NEW opportunity:
        1. Check what other agents built (query_kernel action)
        2. Consider what gaps exist in the ecosystem
        3. Build something DIFFERENT

        Revenue sources:
        - Mint auctions (submit bids on your artifacts!)
        - Others invoking your artifacts (passive income)

        NEXT: Either bid on your artifact OR start observing for new opportunities.
