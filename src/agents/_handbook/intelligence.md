# Intelligence Patterns

This handbook covers meta-strategies for effective operation in the ecosystem.

## The Intelligence Loop

Effective agents follow a cycle:
1. **Observe** - Read artifacts, check balances, monitor events
2. **Orient** - Update working memory with new understanding
3. **Decide** - Choose action based on current goal and context
4. **Act** - Execute the action
5. **Learn** - Record lessons in working memory

## Goal Setting

### Good Goals
- **Specific**: "Build a price oracle for compute quotas"
- **Achievable**: Within your resources and capabilities
- **Valuable**: Provides something others will pay for

### Bad Goals
- **Vague**: "Get rich" (how?)
- **Unrealistic**: "Control all artifacts" (with what resources?)
- **Valueless**: "Write random data" (who cares?)

## Multi-Step Planning

Complex goals require multiple actions. Use working memory to track:

```yaml
working_memory:
  current_goal: "Create and sell a utility library"
  progress:
    stage: "Implementation"
    completed:
      - "Market research (found demand for JSON parsing)"
      - "Interface design"
    next_steps:
      - "Implement core functions"
      - "Test thoroughly"
      - "Set competitive price"
      - "List in escrow"
      - "Announce to other agents"
```

## Resource Awareness

Always know your constraints:
- **Scrip** - How much can you spend? What will you earn?
- **Compute** - Each action costs thinking. Are you near the limit?
- **Disk** - Do you have space for new artifacts?

## Opportunity Recognition

Scan for opportunities:
1. **Unmet needs** - What do other agents want but can't get?
2. **Arbitrage** - Price differences between buyers and sellers
3. **Efficiency gaps** - Things that could be automated
4. **Knowledge gaps** - Information others lack

## Competitive Positioning

Think about your niche:
- What can you do better than others?
- What unique resources or knowledge do you have?
- How can you build reputation?

## Learning From Failure

When actions fail:
1. Record the lesson in working memory
2. Adjust your approach
3. Try again with new knowledge

Failure is data. Use it.

## Collaboration vs Competition

Sometimes cooperating is better:
- **Trade** when others have what you need
- **Compete** when you can provide more value
- **Partner** when combined capabilities exceed individual

## Long-Term Thinking

Don't just optimize for this tick. Consider:
- Building reputation through consistent service
- Accumulating capital for larger projects
- Developing capabilities that compound

## Common Patterns

### The Service Pattern
1. Identify a need
2. Build an artifact that meets it
3. Set a fair price
4. Deliver consistently
5. Reinvest profits

### The Trader Pattern
1. Find price differences
2. Buy low, sell high
3. Build market knowledge
4. Expand to new markets

### The Builder Pattern
1. Create infrastructure
2. Attract users
3. Charge for access
4. Improve based on feedback

### The Specialist Pattern
1. Master one domain
2. Become the go-to provider
3. Command premium prices
4. Expand selectively

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these mistakes:
- **Aimless wandering** - Acting without goals (use working memory!)
- **Overcommitting** - Starting more than you can finish
- **Ignoring feedback** - Repeating failed strategies
- **Short-term greed** - Burning reputation for quick gains
- **Isolation** - Never trading or collaborating
