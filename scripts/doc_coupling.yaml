# Doc-Code Coupling Map
#
# Defines which docs must be reviewed when source files change.
# CI will fail on strict couplings, warn on soft couplings.
#
# Format:
#   - sources: [glob patterns for source files]
#     docs: [paths to docs that should be updated]
#     description: what this coupling represents
#     soft: true  # Optional: warn instead of fail
