# Governance Configuration

# Maps source files to the ADRs that govern them.
# Used by sync_governance.py to generate code headers.

# Format:
#   files:
#     <path>:
#       adrs: [list of ADR numbers]
#       context: |
#         Optional context shown in generated header.
#         Multi-line strings supported.

files:
  src/world/contracts.py:
    adrs: [1, 3]
    context: |
      Permission checks are the hot path - keep them fast.
      Contracts return decisions; kernel applies state changes.

  src/world/genesis_contracts.py:
    adrs: [1, 3]
    context: |
      Four built-in contracts: freeware, self_owned, private, public.
      These are Python classes, not artifacts (current implementation).

  src/world/ledger.py:
    adrs: [1, 2]
    context: |
      All balance mutations go through here.
      Never allow negative balances - fail loud.

  src/world/artifacts.py:
    adrs: [1]
    context: |
      Core artifact storage and management.
      Everything is an artifact - agents, contracts, data.

  src/world/genesis/factory.py:
    adrs: [1, 3]
    context: |
      Genesis artifacts: ledger, mint, escrow, event_log, rights_registry, store.
      System-provided, solve cold-start problem. Split into package (Plan #66).
