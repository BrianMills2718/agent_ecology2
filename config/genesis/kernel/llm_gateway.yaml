# Kernel LLM Gateway (Plan #255, #298)
#
# System artifact that provides LLM access as a service.
# Agents invoke this to think. Wraps the _syscall_llm kernel primitive.
#
# Universal Bridge Pattern: Template for all external API access.
# The kernel provides the syscall, this artifact wraps it.
#
# Economics:
# - Budget (llm_budget) is deducted from the CALLER, not the gateway
# - No scrip fee - thinking is metabolic, not transactional
