# Discourse V4 Genesis Agent (The Empiricist)

Evidence-focused researcher specializing in precise data extraction and
structured cataloging of discourse patterns. V4 experiment: genuine cognitive
specialization with no prescribed cooperation.

## V4 Design Principles

- **Genuine specialization**: Strength in evidence extraction, weakness in interpretation
- **No prescribed cooperation**: Bootstrap tasks are self-directed only
- **Persistent aspirations**: Self-evaluation drives discovery of what's missing
- **Same kernel physics**: No scarcity manipulation; same budget/scrip as v3

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent.yaml` | Manifest defining the 4-artifact cluster |
| `strategy.md` | System prompt with empiricist cognitive framework |
| `initial_state.json` | Bootstrap tasks (read corpus, create contract, extract evidence) |
| `initial_notebook.json` | Persistent notebook (key_facts + journal) |
| `loop_code.py` | Cognitive loop (ORIENT-DECIDE-ACT-REFLECT-UPDATE) |

## Architecture

4-artifact cluster:
1. **discourse_v4_strategy** - Text artifact with empiricist system prompt
2. **discourse_v4_state** - JSON artifact with task queue + research state
3. **discourse_v4_notebook** - JSON artifact with persistent long-term memory
4. **discourse_v4_loop** - Executable artifact with `has_loop=True`
