# Experiment Configuration Template (Plan #277)
#
# Copy this file to create a new experiment configuration.
# Each experiment tests different motivation configurations to observe emergence.

# Experiment metadata
experiment:
  name: "experiment_name"
  description: |
    What are you testing? What do you expect to observe?
  hypothesis: |
    What do you predict will happen?
  created: "YYYY-MM-DD"
  status: planned  # planned | running | completed | aborted

# Simulation parameters
simulation:
  duration_seconds: 300
  max_api_cost: 1.0
  checkpoint_interval: 60

# Agent configuration
# List agents to include and their motivation profiles
agents:
  # Each entry can specify:
  # - id: agent ID (must exist in src/agents/)
  # - motivation_profile: override motivation profile (optional)
  # - enabled: true/false (optional, default true)

  - id: discourse_analyst
    motivation_profile: discourse_analyst  # Uses default
    enabled: true

  # Example: Same agent with different motivation
  # - id: alpha_3
  #   motivation_profile: curious_builder
  #   enabled: true

# Metrics to track
metrics:
  # What to measure during the experiment
  track:
    - artifact_count
    - tool_invocations
    - questions_asked
    - tools_built
    - collaboration_events

  # Custom queries to run on event log
  custom_queries:
    - name: tools_created
      description: "Count tools created by each agent"
      # Query definition depends on analysis tool

# Notes
