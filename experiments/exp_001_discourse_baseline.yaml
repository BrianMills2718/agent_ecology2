# Experiment 001: Discourse Analyst Baseline (Plan #277)
#
# Establish baseline behavior for a single discourse_analyst agent
# with the full motivation configuration.

experiment:
  name: "discourse_analyst_baseline"
  description: |
    Test a single discourse_analyst agent to establish baseline behavior.
    This agent has the discourse analysis telos, research-focused nature,
    and drives for curiosity and capability building.
  hypothesis: |
    The agent should:
    1. Ask questions about discourse structure/patterns
    2. Build tools for discourse analysis
    3. Use tools to analyze text
    4. Reflect and generate deeper questions
    5. Accumulate insights over time

notes: |
  ## Pre-Run Expectations
  - Agent should cycle through: questioning -> investigating -> building/analyzing -> reflecting
  - Should create at least one analysis tool
  - Should record insights in working memory
