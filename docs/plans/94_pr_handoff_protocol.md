# Plan 94: PR Handoff Protocol

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Priority:** Medium
**Blocked By:** None
**Blocks:** None

---

## Gap

**Current:** Owner must return to merge their own PR, creating bottlenecks.

**Target:** Handoff at PR creation - any reviewer can merge.

---

## Files Affected

- `CLAUDE.md` (modify) - Update coordination protocol
- `docs/plans/CLAUDE.md` (modify) - Update plan index
- `docs/plans/93_agent_resource_visibility.md` (create)
- `docs/plans/94_pr_handoff_protocol.md` (create)
- `docs/plans/95_unified_resource_system.md` (create)

---

## Plan

Update "Review vs. Ownership" section in CLAUDE.md to allow any instance to merge after PR creation.

---

## Verification

- [x] CLAUDE.md updated with new protocol
- [x] At least one PR merged by non-owner (already done: PR #285)

---

## Completion Evidence

**Verified:** 2026-01-18
**Validation:** Protocol documented in CLAUDE.md. PR #285 was merged by non-owner using this protocol.
**No code tests required:** This is a process/documentation change only.
