## Relationship to Gap Analysis

This directory tracks **34 high-level gaps** for active implementation.

For the **comprehensive 142-gap analysis**, see `docs/architecture/gaps/`.

| This Directory | Gap Analysis Directory |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Active tracking (status, CC-IDs) | Reference analysis |
| 34 high-level gaps | 142 detailed gaps |
| Implementation steps | Gap definitions |

The 142 gaps are a finer breakdown of these 33. Both track the same work at different granularities.

## How to Use

1. **Find a gap** - Browse the summary table below
2. **Read the plan** - Click through to the detailed plan file
3. **Implement** - Follow the steps in the plan
4. **Update status** - Mark complete in the plan file AND this index
5. **Update current/** - Document the new reality in `docs/architecture/current/`

### Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 📋 Planned | Has implementation plan, ready to start |
| ✅ Complete | Being implemented (see CLAUDE.md for CC-ID) |
| ⏸️ Blocked | Waiting on dependency |
| ❌ Needs Plan | Gap identified, needs design work |
| ✅ Complete | Implemented, docs updated |

## Coordination

**All coordination tables (Active Work, Awaiting Review) are in root `CLAUDE.md`.**

This is the single source of truth for:
- Who is working on what
- Which PRs need review
- Claim/release protocol

See root `CLAUDE.md` → "Multi-Claude Coordination" section.

## TDD Workflow (Thin Slice)

Plans require both unit/integration tests AND E2E verification. **No feature is complete until it runs E2E.**

1. **Define tests** - Add `## Required Tests` section to plan (unit + integration)
2. **Define E2E criteria** - Add `## E2E Verification` section with specific E2E scenario
3. **Write tests** - Create test stubs (they will fail)
4. **Implement** - Code until tests pass
5. **E2E verify** - Run `pytest tests/e2e/test_real_e2e.py -v --run-external`
6. **Complete** - Only after E2E passes

### Why E2E Required

Without E2E verification, we risk the "big bang" problem:
- All unit tests pass ✅
- All integration tests pass ✅
- Real system doesn't work ❌

**Thin slice approach:** Every feature must prove it works end-to-end before declaring success.

### Check Commands

```bash
# List all plans and test counts
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --list

# TDD mode - see what tests to write
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --plan 1 --tdd

# Run all required tests for plan
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --plan 1

# Check all plans with tests
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --all
```
