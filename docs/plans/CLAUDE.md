# Implementation Plans

Master index of all gaps and their implementation plans.

**Last generated:** Auto-updated on every commit

---

## Quick Start

1. **Find a gap** - Browse table below
2. **Read the plan** - `NN_name.md` for details
3. **Implement** - TDD: write tests first
4. **Complete** - `python scripts/complete_plan.py --plan N`

> **Note:** This index is auto-generated from plan files. Edit the plan files,
> not this index. The pre-commit hook regenerates this file automatically.

> **Archive:** Completed plans (1-226) are archived at
> `/home/brian/brian_projects/archive/agent_ecology2/docs/plans/`.
> Only active plans (planned, in-progress, deferred) remain in this directory.

### Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 📋 Planned | Ready to implement |
| 🚧 In Progress | Currently being worked on |
| ✅ Complete | Implemented and verified |
| ❌ Needs Plan | Needs design work |

## TDD Workflow

```bash
# Check what tests to write
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --plan N --tdd

# Run tests for a plan
python scripts/check_plan_tests.py --plan N

# Complete (runs E2E, records evidence)
python scripts/complete_plan.py --plan N
```

---

## Coordination

Active work is tracked by git branches. Check branches with:
```bash
git branch -r | grep plan-
```

Before starting new work:
```bash
make worktree BRANCH=plan-NN-description
```
