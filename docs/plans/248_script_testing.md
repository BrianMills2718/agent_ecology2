# Gap 248: Script Testing — Critical Scripts Untested

**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Priority:** Medium
**Blocked By:** —
**Blocks:** —

---

## Gap

**Current:** 49 Python scripts (~17,881 lines). ~10 scripts (20%) have test coverage via 9 test files. 39 scripts (80%) are untested, including several that perform destructive operations (deleting worktrees, modifying claim state, auto-repair).

**Target:** Test coverage for all destructive and core-logic scripts. Priority: scripts that modify state or delete resources.

**Why Medium:** Destructive scripts running untested is a real risk (logic error = lost work), but these scripts have been running in production without incidents. The risk is latent, not active.

## Open Questions

### Resolved

1. [x] **Question:** Which scripts are already tested?
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer:** ~10 scripts have coverage: check_claims.py, check_doc_coupling.py, check_plan_tests.py, complete_plan.py, validate_plan.py, and a few others via 9 test files (~1,854 lines).
   - **Verified in:** MP-007 investigation (ISSUES.md)

2. [x] **Question:** Which untested scripts are highest risk?
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer:** cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py (deletes worktrees), cleanup_claims_mess.py (modifies state), recover.py (auto-repair), check_plan_blockers.py (modifies plans), check_plan_overlap.py (complex analysis).
   - **Verified in:** MP-007 investigation

3. [x] **Question:** Which scripts are safe to deprioritize?
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
   - **Answer:** Read-only / simple transformation scripts: concat_for_review.py, get_governance_context.py, view_log.py, meta_config.py.

## Plan

### Priority Targets

| Script | Lines | Risk | Test Focus |
|--------|-------|------|------------|
| `cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py` | 275 | High — deletes worktrees | Mock filesystem, verify delete logic only targets orphans |
| `cleanup_claims_mess.py` | 220 | High — modifies claim state | Mock active-work.yaml, verify cleanup rules |
| `recover.py` | 247 | High — auto-repair | Mock state, verify repair logic doesn't corrupt |
| `check_plan_blockers.py` | 276 | Medium — modifies plan files | Mock plan files, verify blocker detection |

### Steps

1. Write tests for `cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py`:
   - Test orphan detection logic (branch merged but worktree exists)
   - Test `--dry-run` vs `--force` behavior
   - Test safety checks (uncommitted changes block deletion)
   - Mock `git worktree list`, `git branch`, filesystem operations

2. Write tests for `cleanup_claims_mess.py`:
   - Test stale claim identification
   - Test cleanup rules (what gets removed, what stays)
   - Test `--dry-run` vs `--apply` behavior
   - Mock `active-work.yaml` state

3. Write tests for `recover.py`:
   - Test individual repair operations
   - Test that repair doesn't corrupt valid state
   - Test error handling for partial failures

4. Write tests for `check_plan_blockers.py`:
   - Test blocker detection from plan file parsing
   - Test plan file modification logic
   - Test edge cases (missing files, malformed plans)

## Required Tests

### New Tests (TDD)

| Test File | Test Function | What It Verifies |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|

| `tests/unit/test_cleanup_orphaned_worktrees.py` | `test_dry_run_no_deletion` | `--dry-run` reports but doesn't delete |

| `tests/unit/test_cleanup_claims_mess.py` | `test_dry_run_preview` | Preview mode shows what would be removed |
| `tests/unit/test_cleanup_claims_mess.py` | `test_apply_removes_stale` | Apply mode actually cleans up |

| `tests/unit/test_check_plan_blockers.py` | `test_handles_missing_plan_files` | Graceful error on missing files |

### Existing Tests (Must Pass)

| Test Pattern | Why |
|--------------|-----|
| `tests/unit/test_check_claims.py` | Existing claim tests unchanged |

## Uncertainties

| Question | Status | Resolution |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Mock strategy — subprocess mocks vs refactoring for testability? | ❓ Open | May need to extract logic from `if __name__` blocks |
| check_plan_overlap.py — complex GitHub API interaction, hard to test | ❓ Open | May need integration test with fixture data |

## Notes

- Scripts safe to deprioritize: `concat_for_review.py`, `get_governance_context.py`, `view_log.py`, `meta_config.py` (read-only, simple transformations)
- Many scripts have logic in `if __name__ == "__main__"` blocks — may need refactoring to extract testable functions
- Use `# mock-ok: subprocess/filesystem isolation` annotations where mocks are unavoidable
