# Glossary

Canonical terminology for Agent Ecology.

## Two Glossaries

This project maintains separate terminology for current vs target architecture:

| Glossary | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| [GLOSSARY_CURRENT.md](GLOSSARY_CURRENT.md) | What IS implemented | Reading/modifying existing code |
| [GLOSSARY_TARGET.md](GLOSSARY_TARGET.md) | What we're BUILDING TOWARD | Architecture discussions, new design |

**After V1:** GLOSSARY_TARGET.md becomes the single source of truth.

## Quick Reference (Stable Terms)

These terms are the same in both:

| Use | Not | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| `scrip` | `credits` | Consistency |
| `principal` | `account` | Principals include artifacts/contracts |
| `tick` | `turn` | Consistency |
| `artifact` | `object/entity` | Everything is an artifact |

For full definitions, see the appropriate glossary above.
