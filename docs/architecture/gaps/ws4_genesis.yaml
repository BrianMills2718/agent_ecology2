    dimension: capabilities
    title: "No contract-based access control system"
    current_state: |
      Access control is hardcoded via policy fields on artifacts (allow_read, read_price, etc.).
      Genesis artifacts have hardcoded behavior that is not user-modifiable.
      No executable contracts exist.
    target_state: |
      Contracts are executable artifacts that answer permission questions.
      Every artifact has an access_contract_id pointing to the contract that governs its permissions.
      Permission checks become contract invocations.

      - Add check_permission tool interface to contracts
      - Add access_contract_id field to all artifacts

    current_state: |
      No standardized interface for permission checking.
      Genesis artifacts have ad-hoc method signatures.

      No genesis contracts exist.
      Only genesis_ledger, genesis_oracle, genesis_rights_registry, genesis_event_log, genesis_escrow.

    title: "No contract execution environment"
    current_state: |
      Genesis artifacts have hardcoded Python class behavior.
      No sandboxed execution for user-created contracts.

      - Full capabilities: invoke artifacts, call LLM, charge principals
      - Time limit: 30 second timeout
      - No filesystem/process access
      - Available APIs: invoke, call_llm, charge, get_artifact_info, get_balance, now()

      Genesis artifacts have fixed compute costs per method defined in config.
      No concept of contract-specified cost models.
    target_state: |
      Contracts specify their own cost model:
      - cost_model field: invoker_pays, owner_pays, artifact_pays, split, or custom
      - Base permission checks cost 0 (to avoid infinite regress)
      - LLM calls and artifact invocations charged per contract logic
      - charge() function available for dynamic charging

    title: "Missing contract execution depth limit"
    current_state: |
      No depth tracking for permission checks.
      Potential for infinite recursion if contract A checks contract B which checks A.
    target_state: |
      MAX_PERMISSION_DEPTH = 10
      Each permission check increments depth counter.
      Exceeding limit returns {allowed: false, reason: "Permission check depth exceeded"}.
    delta: |

    dimension: behaviors
    title: "No owner bypass removal - kernel knows about owners"
    current_state: |
      Ownership checks likely exist at kernel level.
      Ownership transfer requires caller to be current owner (genesis_ledger).
    target_state: |
      The access_contract_id is the ONLY authority.
      No kernel-level owner bypass.
      If owner-based access needed, contract implements it.
      Kernel doesn't know what an "owner" is.
    delta: |
      - Audit all kernel-level permission checks
      - Remove any owner bypass logic
      - Route all permission decisions through contracts
      - Update ownership to be contract-defined

    title: "Missing contract cache policy"
    current_state: |
      No caching for permission checks.
      Each check executes contract fresh.
    target_state: |
      Contracts can opt into fast-path caching:
      - cache_policy field: cacheable, ttl_seconds, cache_key
      - Cache invalidation on artifact content change
      - Cache invalidation on contract change
      - TTL expiry
    delta: |
      - Add cache_policy field to contract schema
      - Implement permission result caching
      - Cache key generation from policy

    current_state: |
      No composition mechanism for access checks.
      Single policy per artifact.
    target_state: |
      Two composition patterns supported:
      1. Caller-side: Artifact has access_contracts (list), caller evaluates each (AND composition)
      2. Meta-contract: Single contract encodes composition logic internally
    delta: |
      - Support access_contracts list on artifacts (optional)
      - Implement AND composition in caller
      - Document meta-contract pattern
    dependencies:
      - GAP-GEN-001
    complexity: M
    risk: low
    files_affected:
      - src/world/artifacts.py
      - src/world/executor.py
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Artifacts can have multiple access contracts
      - AND composition: first failure stops
      - Single contract still works (backward compatible)

      Genesis artifacts controlled by hardcoded behavior.
    target_state: |

    current_state: |
      No mechanism to handle when access_contract_id points to deleted contract.
    target_state: |

    title: "Missing genesis_store mentioned in CLAUDE.md"
    current_state: |
      CLAUDE.md references genesis_store for "Artifact discovery and creation".
      Not documented in genesis_artifacts.md.
      Unclear if implemented.
    target_state: |
      genesis_store should be documented if it exists, or implemented if it doesn't:
      - Purpose: Artifact discovery and creation
      - Methods: TBD based on target architecture
    delta: |
      - Verify if genesis_store is implemented
      - If yes: document in genesis_artifacts.md
      - If no: implement or remove from CLAUDE.md

    title: "Custom contracts not supported"
    current_state: |
      Only genesis (hardcoded) contracts exist.
      Agents cannot create their own contracts.
    target_state: |
      Agents can create contracts for any access pattern:
      - Paid read access contracts
      - Multi-sig access contracts
      - Time-based access contracts
      - Any custom permission logic
    delta: |
      - Enable contract creation by agents
      - Validate contracts implement required interface
      - Support LLM-based permission decisions
      - Support external API calls in contracts

      - Agents can create_artifact with has_loop=true
      - Created contracts validated for interface
      - Custom contracts execute correctly
      - Examples work (paid read, multi-sig)

    title: "Orphan artifacts not documented as accepted risk"
    current_state: |
      No documentation about orphan artifacts in current docs.
    target_state: |
      Orphan artifacts are accepted risk:
      - Artifacts can become permanently inaccessible
      - No automatic rescue mechanism
      - Many loops are valuable (mutual interdependence)
      - Detection is impossible (external state, time, LLM)
      - Adding backdoors breaks security model
      - Creators responsible for careful design
    delta: |
      - Document orphan artifact risk in current docs
      - Ensure no kernel-level rescue mechanisms
      - Accept as system behavior

    current_state: |
      Unclear what happens to scrip when agents are lost/defunct.
    target_state: |
      No scrip destruction:
      - Scrip circulates forever
      - Lost agents' scrip remains in system
      - Can be recovered by vulture capitalists if agent rescued
    delta: |
      - Verify no scrip destruction occurs
      - Document scrip permanence
      - Ensure vulture recovery possible

      mint_ratio config:
      - scrip_minted = score / mint_ratio
      - Example: mint_ratio=10, score 80 = 8 scrip
      - Only source of NEW scrip in system
    delta: |
      - Document mint_ratio in current docs
