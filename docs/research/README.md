# Research

Design explorations, literature reviews, and architectural research.

## Purpose

Capture research and design thinking that informs architecture decisions. Unlike `simulation_learnings/` (which captures observations from runs), this contains:
- Design space explorations
- Literature reviews and external references
- Architectural pattern research
- Synthesis documents

## Contents

- `agent_architecture_design_space.md` - Exploration of agent cognitive architectures
- `agent_architecture_research_notes.md` - Notes from researching agent patterns
- `agent_architecture_synthesis.md` - Synthesis of research into actionable design
- `emergence_research_questions.md` - Open questions requiring experimentation
